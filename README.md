Kiota is an apartment-hunting app designed for people living in Tokyo, Japan.

It makes use of an engaging series of questions to guage what is most important to the user. Then, in 'Tinder-like' style it presents the user with a series of properties they may choose to 'swipe right' or 'swipe-left' on.

Once they have selected their favorites, the user can then get into contact with the property owner or real estate agent to set up a time and place to view the properties they like.

 I was the lead developer and project manager for Kiota and it was built over the course of 5 weeks. It uses many technologies, mainly Ruby on Rails, but also Javascript, Active Record database management, Bootstrap and CSS. Designed primarily for mobile applications.
